## Overview
This application will be able to generate six unique random numbers from 1 - 59 to use for a lottery entry, with an ability to reset the numbers and generate them again.

**Learning** 
I will use the Python Tkinter module, as this is the primary tool for creating GUI's. I have never used this before so quickly picking up this module will be core to the success of the application.
